Interested in helping us out? We are looking for help to port popular open source deep learning projects onto Floyd.

## What you need to do
- Pick a deep learning project of your choice. Here are some popular ones [http://deeplearninggallery.com/](http://deeplearninggallery.com/)
- Email us with your project before getting started: [community@floydhub.com](mailto:community@floydhub.com). We'll make sure there's no redundancy.
- Run the project on Floyd (Training and Evaluation). Make sure the README has instructions on how to replicate it. See a [Neural Style Transfer](http://docs.floydhub.com/guides/style_transfer/) example.
- Email us with a link to your repo. Profit!

## What you get in return
We will offer 50 hours of free GPU credits for each complete project ported

## Miscellaneous
- The project should be open source under a liberal license (think MIT)
- It should use publicly available training and test data
