You can setup Slack notifications to receive alerts on your jobs.  You will receive a notification when:

* Job completes successfully
* Idel Jupyter job is shutdown automatically
* Job fails due to error in code
* Job fails due to timeout or insufficient powerup credits
* User manually cancels the job


In Floydhub, go to [Notifications settings](https://www.floydhub.com/settings/notifications), paste in the Slack webhook url, and click save.

[help page](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005265063-Incoming-WebHooks-for-Slack).
