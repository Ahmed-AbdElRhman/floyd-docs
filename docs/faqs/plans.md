### What is in the Trial Plan?

FloydHub offers a Trial Plan for users to try out the platform. This plan includes 2 hours of free GPU compute credits (or 20 hours of CPU compute). Please refer to our [Quick Start Guide](../getstarted/quick_start.md) or [Jupyter Notebook Guide](../getstarted/quick_start_jupyter.md) to try Floyd out!

The free plan comes with the follow limits:

- 1 concurrent job: This means that you can only run one job at a time
- 1 hour job timeout: The maximum runtime of a job on the Trial Plan is 1 hour. It will automatically timeout after that

You can upgrade to the [Paid Plan](https://www.floydhub.com/pricing) to overcome these limits.


### Why did I not get 100 free GPU hours when I signed up?

We offered 100 hours of free GPU for all users during our promotional period. This has ended. 

In our current Trial Plan, all users get 2 hours of free GPU compute time for running your projects. We hope this will give you enough time to evaluate Floydhub for your needs. We are working on a new free plan right now to better help new users explore the platform.


### Is there a student discount?

Not at the moment, but we are currently working out a Student Plan. We will
post the details very soon :)
