## Create a new Project

A [Project]() is a collection of the jobs you run and their data, logs and results. If you have used GitHub, projects in FloydHub are a lot like code repositories.

To create a new Project, visit [www.floydhub.com/projects](https://www.floydhub.com/projects) and click on the "New Project" button on the top right hand corner.

Give the project a name and an apt description.

The `Visibility` field indicates who can see your project. If you set it to `Public`, anyone can see your project, your code and data. If you are working on an open source project, this is a great way to share and contribute to the FloydHub community. If your code or data is proprietary, please select `Private`. This will ensure that only you and your team will have access to this project.
