### How does the free CPU / GPU hours work?

Every one who signups to Floydhub will receive 2 hours of free CPU / GPU time
for running your projects. We hope this will give you enough time to evaluate
Floydhub for your needs. We are working on a new free plan right now to better
help new users explore the platform.

### Is there a student discount?

Not at the moment, but we are currently working out a Student Plan. We will
post the details very soon :)
