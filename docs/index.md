## Explore, train and deploy your deep learning projects using FloydHub


### What is FloydHub?
[FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) is a platform for data scientists building deep learning and AI applications. 

Using FloydHub, you can:

- Explore popular deep learning projects and datasets
- Train your *own* deep learning models on the cloud without *any* DevOps
- Share and collaborate on your projects
- Deploy your models as REST endpoints

If you are a fan of analogies, we can be described as:

- **Github for deep learning**: Explore, share and collaborate on projects and datasets
- **Heroku for deep learning**: Train and deploy your models with zero DevOps

Even though our current focus is on deep learning, FloydHub works great for other AI, machine learning and data science applications too.

### Why use FloydHub?

- **Easy**: We worry about provisioning GPUs, installating drivers and managing software dependency hell, so you don't have to. Training a PyTorch model using GPUs on the cloud is as simple as executing this command on your terminal `floyd run --gpu --env pytorch "python train.py"`
- **Tooling**: Our tools make your work easier and your team more productive. We offer Jupyter Notebook support, end-to-end version control, full reproducibility, and a lot more.
- **Community**: Explore our community projects and datasets. Get inspired, fork and run your own version or create your own.
