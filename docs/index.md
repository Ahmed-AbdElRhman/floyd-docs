## Introduction
Welcome to [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/)! Here you'll find comprehensive information for training and deploying your deep learning and AI applications with our platform. We've tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled, but if you have any questions, please visit the [community forum](https://forum.floydhub.com/) or [contact us](mailto:support@floydhub.com).

The fastest way to get up and running is to use our [quickstart guide](http://docs.floydhub.com/getstarted/quick_start), which walks through an entire FloydHub training job step-by-step. You'll create a new Project on the FloydHub web dashboard, connect it to a local directory on your computer, and then kick-off a job using the FloydHub CLI to train your deep learning model on FloydHub's GPU servers.

## Deep learning without the DevOps:

### Frictionless data science
Why worry about provisioning GPUs, installing drivers, or managing software dependency hell? With FloydHub, we take care of your entire deep learning DevOps workflow - so you can focus on the science.

Training a PyTorch model using GPUs on the cloud is as simple as executing this command on your terminal: 
`floyd run --gpu --env pytorch "python train.py"`. Try it now with our [quickstart guide](http://docs.floydhub.com/getstarted/quick_start).

### Powerful workflow tools
Whether you're using our web dashboard or our command line interface, our tools make your work easier and your team more productive:

- [Interactive Jupyter Notebook support](http://docs.floydhub.com/getstarted/quick_start_jupyter/)
- End-to-end version control for data science
- Full reproducibility of experiments
- Deploy models as REST endpoints to integrate with your apps

### Deep learning community

FloydHub hosts open source Projects and Datasets that you can discover, clone, and reproduce (or reconfigure with your own Dataset).

Try it now with the [Neural Style Transfer](http://docs.floydhub.com/examples/style_transfer/).
